**New payment funnel - test results**


I've received an analytical task from an international online store. My predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

Expected result: within 14 days of signing up, users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), product card views (product_card) and purchases (purchase). At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.
